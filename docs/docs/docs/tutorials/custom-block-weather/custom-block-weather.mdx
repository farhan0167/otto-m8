In the previous section, we saw how we can modify the implementation of an existing block. In this
tutorial, we're going to see how we can create our own custom block that implements something that
isn't yet provided by otto-m8.

We will be building a weather block, which given the name of a city will then return its weather. More
specifically, we will be integrating the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) api to get this
job done.

### First Step: Ask Chat 

For the best interest of time, we'll simply ask OpenAI's chat completion to give us the code on how to 
implement it.

Here is what otto-m8's assistant had to say:

To integrate the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the temperature for a given city, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Sign Up for an API Key
Go to the OpenWeatherMap website.
Sign up for an account and log in.
Navigate to the API section and subscribe to the plan that suits your needs (there's a free tier available).
Once subscribed, you will receive an API key. Keep this key secure, as you'll need it for authentication.

#### Step 2: Choose a Weather API Endpoint
For current weather data, you can use the following endpoint:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

#### Step 3: Make a Request to the API
You can make a request to the API using various methods (e.g., curl, Postman, or programming languages). Below is an example using Python.

##### Example in Python

You can use the requests library to make an API call. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so via pip:

pip install requests
Here's a simple script to get the temperature for a given city:

```python
import requests

def get_temperature(city_name, api_key):
    # OpenWeatherMap API endpoint for current weather
    base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    
    # Defining parameters for the API call
    params = {
        'q': city_name,
        'appid': api_key,
        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit
    }
    
    # Make the GET request
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        # Extract temperature from the response data
        temperature = data['main']['temp']
        return temperature
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json().get('message')}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    city = input("Enter the city name: ")
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    temperature = get_temperature(city, api_key)
    if temperature is not None:
        print(f"The current temperature in {city} is: {temperature}Â°C")
```

#### Step 4: Run the Script
Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
Run the script in a Python environment. You will be prompted to enter a city name.
The script will output the current temperature for the specified city.

### Select the Custom Code Block

Now that we have a starter code, we can simply go ahead and create a new workflow. 

#### Add Block

From there, click on Add Block -> Custom Block as shown below:

![select-block](https://farhan0167-otto-m8.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tutorials/weather/selectblock.gif)

#### The starter code

If you click on the View Code icon, you'll see a skeleton code that should help you get started with building
your own block. The skeleton code looks as follows:

```python
import json
from implementations.base import (
    BaseImplementation,
    BlockMetadata,
    Field
)

class CustomBlock(BaseImplementation):
    display_name = "Custom Block"
    block_type = 'process'
    block_metadata = BlockMetadata([])
    
    def __init__(self, run_config:dict=None) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        
    def run(self, input_:dict=None):
        return input_
```

#### Objective

Our objective is to create a block that will query the OpenWeatherMaps API. As we see
in the [example implementation](/docs/tutorials/custom-block-weather/#example-in-python),
we have a few parameters that can be configurable:

```python
# Defining parameters for the API call
params = {
    'q': city_name,
    'appid': api_key,
    'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit
}
```

Therefore, we want to offer users the option to configure an API key and the units they want to use. The q, or city name, 
is what we'll recieve as input. 

#### Let's get coding

In the custom block's implementation, simply go ahead and paste the below code snippet.


<details>
<summary>Custom code snippet to copy</summary>

```python
import json
import requests

from implementations.base import (
    BaseImplementation,
    BlockMetadata,
    Field,
    FieldType
)

class CustomBlock(BaseImplementation):
    display_name = "Custom Weather Block"
    block_type = 'process'
    block_metadata = BlockMetadata([
        Field(
            name='api_key',
            display_name='API Key',
            type=FieldType.PASSWORD.value,
            show_in_ui=False
        ),
        Field(
            name='units',
            display_name='Units',
            type=FieldType.TEXT.value,
            default_value='metric',
            show_in_ui=False
        ),
    ])
    
    def __init__(self, run_config:dict=None) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.run_config = run_config
        self.api_key = run_config.get('api_key')
        self.units = run_config.get('units')
        
    def run(self, input_:dict=None):
        input_ = list(input_.values())[0]
        
        base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
        # Defining parameters for the API call
        params = {
            'q': input_,
            'appid': self.api_key,
            'units': self.units  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit
        }
        
        # Make the GET request
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        
        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            # Extract temperature from the response data
            temperature = data['main']['temp']
            return temperature
        else:
            print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json().get('message')}")
            return None
```
</details>

So let's break things up:

1. First and foremost, we import the libraries that weren't imported.
    ```python
        import requests
        from implementations.base import (
            ...
            FieldType
        )
    ```
2. We give the block's display name to be `Custom Weather Block`. This is what will
show up on the Add Block sidebar.

3. We add the fields we want the users to be able to configure.
    ```python
        block_metadata = BlockMetadata([
        Field(
            name='api_key',
            display_name='API Key',
            type=FieldType.PASSWORD.value,
            show_in_ui=False
        ),
        Field(
            name='units',
            display_name='Units',
            type=FieldType.TEXT.value,
            default_value='metric',
            show_in_ui=False
        ),
    ])
    ```

4. Then we set up the logic for when the block will initialize. Our goal is to capture
the user configurables through the `run_config`. So we have something like this:
    ```python
    def __init__(self, run_config:dict=None) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.run_config = run_config
        self.api_key = run_config.get('api_key') # This has the same name as Field.name
        self.units = run_config.get('units')
    ```
5. Then we write the logic that our Chat assistant, for implementing the API, gave us:
    ```python
    def run(self, input_:dict=None):
        # This is essentially taking the first output from the previous block.
        # We do [0] because we don't expect to have this block have more than 1 incoming connections.
        input_ = list(input_.values())[0]
        

        base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
        # Defining parameters for the API call
        params = {
            'q': input_, # swap out the city_name with the input
            'appid': self.api_key, # swap out api_key for what we got from run_config
            'units': self.units  # swap out units for what we got from run_config
        }
        # The rest of the code you'll notice stays the same.
        # Make the GET request
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        
        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            # Extract temperature from the response data
            temperature = data['main']['temp']
            return temperature
        else:
            print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json().get('message')}")
            return None
    ```

### Overview

![final](https://farhan0167-otto-m8.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tutorials/weather/final.gif)

In this tutorial, we saw how we can create our own custom code blocks by building a weather API
integration. It goes on to show that not only can you modify the implementation of blocks that otto-m8
provide but also create your own implementations. 

**Note**: Currently if there's a dependency that otto-m8 doesnt have installed, importing them while
writing custom code can give you errors. One way to circumvent that is to go on `http://localhost:3000/terminal`
and run `poetry add <package_name>`, which should install the dependency in the otto-m8 server.
